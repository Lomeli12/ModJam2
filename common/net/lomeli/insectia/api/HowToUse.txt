Insectia API
============

This is the beta API for Insectia, use
mostly for creating new Bugs and Insect Housing,
though it allows you to access the mod's
items as well.

This API will change in the future, as this
mod is more of a proof of concept, and  should
I continue it, I will rewrite it to include more
features.

--General--

When creating a addon for Insectia,
remember to take into account players
without Insectia installed. You can check by
adding Insectia as a dependancy.

@Mod(modid = "dummymodid", name = "DummyMod, 
    version = "1.0", dependencies="required-after:Insectia")
    
Or, you can have your custom content simply not 
load if Insectia isn't installed.

if (Loader.isModLoaded("insectia")){
     try{
          //Load Custom stuff
     }catch(Exception ex){
          //throw error
     }
}else{
     //throw error
}

--Creating a new bug--

Creating a bug is fairly simple,
simply create an net.minecraft.item.Item class
that implements IInsect

Remember to register your bugs in the
InsectRegistry so that it'll work with
"vanilla" mod items

InsectRegistry.getInstance().registerInsect(myInsect, true);

--Creating new Insect housing--

Simply implement IHousing in the tileEntity
of your new Insect housing. ISidedInventory/IInventory
is also recommended
