Insectia API
============

This is the beta API for Insectia, use
mostly for creating new Bugs and Insect Housing,
though it allows you to access the mod's
items as well.

--General--

When creating a addon for Insectia,
remember to take into account players
without Insectia installed. You can check by
adding Insectia as a dependancy.

@Mod(modid = "dummymodid", name = "DummyMod, 
    version = "1.0", dependencies="required-after:Insectia")
    
Or, you can have your custom content simply not 
load if Insectia isn't installed.

if (Loader.isModLoaded("insectia")){
     try{
          //Load Custom stuff
     }catch(Exception ex){
          //throw error
     }
}else{
     //throw error
}

--Creating a new bug--

Creating a bug is fairly simple,
simply create an net.minecraft.item.Item class
that implements IInsect

Remember to register your bugs in the
InsectRegistry so that it'll work with
"vanilla" mod items

InsectRegistry.getInstance().registerInsect(myInsect, true);

--Creating new Insect housing--

Simply implement ILivingQuarters in the tileEntity
of your new Insect housing. ISidedInventory/IInventory
is also recommended
